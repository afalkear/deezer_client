= Usage

For Rails 4, in your Gemfile add: (Should work in Rails 3 too, but I haven't tested it yet)

  gem 'protected_attributes' # I'm trying to put this into them but haven't managed yet.
  gem 'logical_model'        # I'm trying to put this into them but haven't managed yet.
  gem 'deezer_client'

Then you can do:

  track = Deezer::Track.find(67606633)
  track.title # "Until Nothing Remains"

  track.artist # <Deezer::Artist: ....>
  track.artist.name # "Boy Sets Fire"

  track.album # <Deezer::Album: ....>
  track.album.title # "While a Nation Sleeps..."

== Async read

This client uses Typhoeus. So you can run several requests on parallel

  Deezer::Track.async_find(67606633) { |res| @track = res }
  Deezer::Album.async_find(6618908) { |res| @album = res }

  @track # nil
  @album # nil

  Deezer::HYDRA.run

  @track # <Deezer::Track: ....>
  @album # <Deezer::Album: ....>
